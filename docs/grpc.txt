# gRPC Documentation:

According to my microservice design, the gRPC is being used along with Kafka cluster to receive a location data
from the LocationProducer and send it to LocationConsumer.

The gRPC implementation for sending a request exists in `modules/location-producer/app/udaconnect/server.py`.

This python script which is responsible for sending the location data to `location-consumer` module through gRPC using the
`LocationMessage` object which is defined the `location.proto` file in the same directory.

'''
message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 1;
    float longitude = 2;
    float latitude = 3;
}

service LocationService {
    rpc Create (LocationMessage) returns (LocationMessage);
}
